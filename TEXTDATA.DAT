    4Useful commands: 
    4  
    4   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions 
    4for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses 
    4printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'   
    4command restores long descriptions.  
    4   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea  
    4of what the game is about. 
    4   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish  
    4to continue playing.  
    4   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation. 
    4   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.  
    4   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.   
    4   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.   
    4   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking. 
    4   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing. 
    4   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.   
    4  
    4Command abbreviations:  
    4  
    4   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.  
    4   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.  
    4   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.  
    4  
    4Containment:  
    4  
    4   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can 
    4be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may 
    4not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object 
    4which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you 
    4to see such an object, the container must be either open or   
    4transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;  
    4the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their 
    4sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be  
    4in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program  
    4will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which  
    4process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers 
    4can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than 
    4one level down.  
    4  
    4Fighting:   
    4  
    4   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when  
    4attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked. 
    4Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL', 
    4etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a 
    4fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,  
    4getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength. 
    4Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to 
    4fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details  
    4should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.  
    4  
    4Command parser:  
    4  
    4   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.  
    4For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their 
    4first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing   
    4'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also 
    4creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca- 
    4tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words. 
    4  
    4   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands  
    4the following types of things-- 
    4  
    4   Actions: 
    4   Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc. 
    4   Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,  
    4   PUT DOWN, etc.  
    4  
    4   Directions:   
    4   NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.  
    4   Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in 
    4   only certain situations.  
    4  
    4   Objects: 
    4   Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.  
    4  
    4   Adjectives:   
    4   Some adjectives are understood and required when there are   
    4   two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,   
    4   DOORs, BUTTONs).  
    4  
    4   Prepositions: 
    4   It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but 
    4   the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous   
    4   without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON 
    4   CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.   
    4   When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR  
    4   WITH DEMON' won't parse.  
    4  
    4   Sentences: 
    4   The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc- 
    4   tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas) 
    4   can be placed on the same line.  
    4  
    4   Ambiguity: 
    4   The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of  
    4   actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.  
    4   If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume 
    4   that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.  
    4   Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.  
    5Welcome to Dungeon!   
    5  
    5   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast  
    5quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it. 
    5In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To   
    5receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy 
    5case in the living room of the house.  
    5  
    5   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects  
    5which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may 
    5need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons, 
    5since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading   
    5material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it 
    5is rumored to be useful.   
    5  
    5   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.  
    5When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a 
    5certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding 
    5the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure  
    5safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In   
    5addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated   
    5with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,   
    5which you may do only twice. 
    5  
    5   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who 
    5likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the 
    5light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure  
    5rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which 
    5you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste   
    5he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines 
    5his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-  
    5ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders 
    5through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).   
    6Please answer the question.  
    7You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the 
    7dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be   
    7installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers 
    7may gloat over them.  
    8What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running  
    8RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.  
    9Now let me see...  
    9Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have 
    9everything. 
   10Do you wish me to try to patch you?  
   11You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house   
   11there is a window which is #.   
   12open   
   13slightly ajar 
   14You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have  
   14been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to  
   14the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the 
   14east is a small window which is #.   
   15You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west  
   15is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be  
   15nailed shut.  
   16You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west  
   16is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some  
   16strange gothic lettering.  
   17In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.  
   18In the center of the room is a closed trap door. 
   19In the center of the room is an open trap door.  
   20There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.  
   21You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading 
   21east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a 
   21steep metal ramp which is unclimbable. 
   22The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.  
   23You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty 
   23passages in the immediate vicinity.  
   24Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock. 
   25Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.   
   26Above you is a grating. 
   27You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west   
   27and south.  
   28There is a grating securely fastened into the ground. 
   29There is an open grating descending into darkness.  
   30A grating appears on the ground.  
   31You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir. 
   32You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a  
   32reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely 
   32a wide stream running through the center of the room. 
   33There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway   
   33climbing up along the edge of a cliff. 
   34You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south. 
   34Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow 
   34cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.  
   35You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a   
   35large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.   
   36You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.  
   37You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly   
   37a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely 
   37a wide stream running through the center of the room. 
   38There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north. 
   39You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls  
   39and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.  
   40Part of the glacier has been melted. 
   41There is a large passageway leading westward.  
   42You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits  
   42on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is   
   42an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.  
   43Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless  
   43actions. 
   44            BOOOOOOOOOM 
   45You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one   
   45corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes   
   45dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an   
   45obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the  
   45label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-   
   45ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4 
   45inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #. 
   46closed 
   47The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.  
   48You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.  
   49In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who  
   49is obviously deranged and holding his nose. 
   50A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down  
   50from the ceiling and lifts you away... 
   51You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling  
   51of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a  
   51wooden railing which circles the dome. 
   52Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet  
   52from the floor below. 
   53I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.  
   54You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down 
   54staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a 
   54large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up 
   54around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the   
   54center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.  
   55A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some 
   55five feet above your head. 
   56You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.  
   57Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.  
   58According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic  
   58fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.   
   58I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.   
   59You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:  
   59  
   59   "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."  
   59  
   59The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of  
   59mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some  
   59hideous fate, can be heard.  
   60The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your 
   60attempts to pass.  
   61There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the 
   61cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you 
   61are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.  
   62You are not equipped for an exorcism.  
   63There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the 
   63cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense 
   63of a greater power, flee through the walls. 
   64You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate  
   64room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the  
   64sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In 
   64the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous 
   64adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east 
   64is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.   
   65Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,   
   65tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.  
   66You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was  
   66quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths  
   66to the north, south, east, and down. 
   67The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can 
   67be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from  
   67the lake.   
   68It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind   
   68the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-  
   68stream through the gates.  
   69There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the 
   69panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.  
   70The green bubble is glowing. 
   71The water level is now up to your ankles. 
   72The water level is now up to your shins.  
   73The water level is now up to your knees.  
   74The water level is now up to your hips.   
   75The water level is now up to your waist.  
   76The water level is now up to your chest.  
   77The water level is now up to your neck.   
   78The water level is now over your head. 
   79The water level is now high in your lungs.  
   80The room is full of water and cannot be entered. 
   81I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.  
   82You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway. 
   82Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense. 
   83The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room  
   83suddenly vanish. 
   84Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.   
   85Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very  
   85smart thing to do, apparently.  
   86You seem to be digging a hole here.  
   87The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it. 
   88You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.  
   89You can see a small statue in the sand.   
   90The wall collapses, smothering you.  
   91There is nothing to dig into here.   
   92You are digging into a pile of bat guano. 
   93You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.  
   94You are covered with bat turds, cretin.   
   95This is getting you nowhere. 
   96You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a  
   96drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.   
   96There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into. 
   97A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east. 
   98A solid rainbow spans the falls.  
   99According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic  
   99fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards 
   99of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming   
   99out of its ears, and it has stopped moving. 
  100You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the  
  100volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop   
  100below to the floor.   
  101The way to the south is blocked by rubble.  
  102There is a small door to the south.  
  103The way to the south is blocked by rubble.  
  104You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except 
  104for an exit on the north size.  
  105Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that 
  105the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been 
  105chipped out of the front of it. 
  106On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.  
  107You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.   
  107There are exits to the east and southeast.  
  108As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.  
  109The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on. 
  110The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape. 
  111The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.  
  112The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.  
  113The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large 
  113chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the  
  113ground.  Fatally.  
  114The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.  
  115You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of 
  115that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the  
  115dungeon has collapsed.  
  116The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you, 
  116turning you into a pancake.  
  117The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses, 
  117turning you into a pancake.  
  118A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,   
  118"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on 
  118trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out." 
  118You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch. 
  119Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears  
  119seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible  
  119voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You  
  119have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them  
  119all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"  
  119He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a  
  119wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

  121Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.   
  122The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust 
  122at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.  
  123The lid opens.   
  124The lid closes.  
  125Look around.  
  126You think it isn't?   
  127I think you've already done that. 
  128The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any   
  128attempt by robbers to remove it). 
  129The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated. 
  130The basket is at the other end of the chain.   
  131A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle. 
  132The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.   
  133The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.  
  134It is not tied to anything.  
  135There is nothing it can be tied to.  
  136The rope is already attached.   
  137The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor. 
  138I see no objects here.  
  139Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free. 
  140The rope drops gently to the floor below. 
  141The rope is tied to the railing.  
  142The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.   
  143The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you   
  143notice an irregularity beneath it.   
  144The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.   
  145With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.  
  145With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears. 
  146Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible 
  146to move it again.  
  147You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.   
  148Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.  
  149The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an 
  149an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.   
  150Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties  
  150than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.   
  151There is an explosion nearby.   
  152The wire rapidly burns into nothing. 
  153The match has gone out. 
  154The lamp appears to be getting dimmer. 
  155The lamp is dying. 
  156The candles grow short. 
  157The candles are very short.  
  158The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain. 
  159The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends  
  159the neighbors that they come over and put you out.  
  160As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse 
  160of blinding blue light. 
  161As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an   
  161overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade  
  161is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it   
  161savagely cuts your throat. 
  162A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration 
  162of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on   
  162all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of 
  162the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities. 
  163There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes. 
  164There is an ugly person staring at you.   
  165The mirror is broken into many pieces. 
  166Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick. 
  167You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of 
  167good luck available.  
  168Haven't you done enough already?  
  169The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,  
  169devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes  
  169downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,  
  169there is a passageway leading west.  
  170The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving  
  170you in the dark. 
  171The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.  
  172Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.  
  173burned out ivory torch  
  174There is a burned out ivory torch here.   
  175The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.  
  176The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.   
  177The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain. 
  178You seem unable to affect these spirits.  
  179How can you attack a spirit with material objects?  
  180The book is open to page 569.   
  181As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed. 
  182A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you 
  182have turned into a pile of dust.  
  183I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.   
  184One of the matches starts to burn.   
  185The match is out.  
  186The tube refuses to accept anything. 
  187The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him. 
  188The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.  
  188The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em." 
  189The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use   
  189a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the  
  189gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.  
  190The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you  
  190put in that drink, anyway?). 
  191The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses 
  191your generous gesture.  
  192The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit. 
  193The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!   
  194The cyclops seems somewhat agitated. 
  195The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated. 
  196The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.  
  197The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering   
  197condiments for his upcoming snack.   
  198The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.  
  199You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.  
  200Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but  
  200they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either. 
  201The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug. 
  202The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.   
  203You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied. 
  204Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you 
  204tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.  
  205Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the   
  205artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one. 
  206worthless piece of canvas  
  207There is a worthless piece of canvas here.  
  208With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.  
  209The window closes (more easily than it opened).  
  210The bolt won't turn with your best effort.  
  211The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.  
  212The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.  
  213You can't do that! 
  214The grating is locked.  
  215The grating opens to reveal trees above you.   
  216The grating opens. 
  217The grating is unlocked.   
  218The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending  
  218into darkness.   
  219The door swings shut and closes.  
  220The door is locked from above.  
  221The door cannot be opened. 
  222You cannot burn this door. 
  223The door is invulnerable.  
  224You cannot damage this door. 
  225The door is still under warranty. 
  226The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display   
  226of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the 
  226excitement fades.  
  227The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything. 
  228A force keeps you from taking the bodies. 
  229The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,   
  229"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole. 
  230The lights within the room shut off. 
  231The lights within the room come on.  
  232Click. 
  233There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst  
  233from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred 
  233in a pipe). 
  234The blue button appears to be jammed.  
  235The boat must be on the ground to be inflated. 
  236The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.  
  237You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.  
  238This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.  
  239Well done.  The boat is repaired. 
  240There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.  
  241The boat deflates. 
  242You can't deflate the boat while you're in it. 
  243The boat must be on the ground to be deflated. 
  244Very good.  
  245The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill. 
  246Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture, 
  246walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister). 
  247The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined  
  247precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported 
  247by water vapor.  
  248The ballon is fastened to the hook.  
  249The balloon is not tied to anything. 
  250The wire falls off the hook. 
  251The box is imbedded in the wall.  
  252What do you expect, BOOM?  
  253The box has no door!  
  254The box is rusted and will not open. 
  255The box is not open, chomper!   
  256The wire starts to burn.   
  257"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a 
  257# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end  
  257of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney 
  257sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears 
  257from sight. 
  258"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching 
  258the # in his rock hard hands.   
  259The gnome appears increasingly nervous.   
  260Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin  
  260would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to 
  260prevent this. 
  261Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for 
  261your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and  
  261of your life. 
  262Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately 
  262for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately. 
  263As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling   
  263to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming 
  263into the room.   
  264As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the  
  264ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it. 
  264Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and   
  264crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor. 
  265There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp. 
  266Nothing seems to happen.   
  267The whirring increases in intensity slightly.  
  268The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.  
  269A dull thump is heard in the distance. 
  270The flask breaks into pieces.   
  271Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.   
  272Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the 
  272flask's contents are fatal.  
  273Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large. 
  274The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to 
  274be clearly visible.   
  275You can't see through that!  
  276The letters appear larger but are still too small to read. 
  277The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".   
  278The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE". 
  279The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".   
  280The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices. 
  281The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble   
  281from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing  
  281with blasting cakes.  
  282You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).  
  283The room around you seems to be getting smaller. 
  284The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems  
  284that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is 
  284more or less demolished.   
  285The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the 
  285floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.  
  286How romantic! 
  287If you must... Poof, you're dead! 
  288The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the 
  288earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable  
  288appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been  
  288seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws  
  288to tell the tale.  
  289There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in 
  289the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!  
  290The bucket rises and comes to a stop.  
  291The bucket descends and comes to a stop.  
  292You notice that the # has burned out, and that 
  292the cloth bag is starting to deflate.  
  293I hope you have more light than from a #. 
  294I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a  
  294# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,  
  294there is still justice in the world. 
  295Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal  
  295gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.  
  296There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.  
  297The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately. 
  298You won't melt it with a #.  
  299The bolt can't be turned with your #.  
  300It seems that a # won't do.  
  301With a #?   
  302The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike  
  302appendage in thanks.  
  303A #?  Surely you jest.  
  304He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the 
  304kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.   
  305You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you. 
  306I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.   
  307At your service! 
  308The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon. 
  309Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too! 
  310It could very well be too late. 
  311The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).   
  312Naturally!  
  313AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!   
  314Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.  
  315Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?  
  316Are you enjoying yourself? 
  317Wheeeeee!   
  318Do you expect me to applaud? 
  319Such language in a high-class establishment like this!   
  320You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
  321It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already. 
  322Tough shit, asshole.  
  323Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!  
  324That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON. 
  325I think you are taking this thing for granite. 
  326Brief descriptions.   
  327Maximum verbosity. 
  328No long descriptions. 
  329You can see:  A #. 
  330Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.  
  331I don't really see how. 
  332I think that swimming is best performed in water.   
  333Perhaps it is your head that is swimming. 
  334Wasn't he an Indian?  
  335I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a 
  335barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number 
  335of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.   
  336Wasn't he a sailor?   
  337The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room  
  337by knocking down the wall on the north size of the room. 
  338There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens. 
  339Well what?  
  340If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.   
  341Nothing happens. 
  342I don't really know how to do that.  
  343Do you wish to leave the game?  
  344Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating. 
  345Underneath the rug is a closed trap door. 
  346Hello. 
  347Good day.   
  348Nice weather we've been having lately. 
  349Goodbye. 
  350Here, nothing happens.  
  351Nothing happens here. 
  352I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out. 
  353You seem to be repeating yourself.   
  354The # bows his head to you in greeting.   
  355I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.  
  356It is impossible to read in the dark.  
  357How does one look through a #?  
  358How can I read a #?   
  359How, exactly, do I ring that?   
  360Ding, dong. 
  361I'm not sure that a # can be melted. 
  362If you wish, but I can't understand why.  
  363Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what   
  363you want to brush them with. 
  364A nice idea, but with a #? 
  365Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of  
  365glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose, 
  365and you die of respiratory failure.  
  366Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.  
  367Inflating it further would probably burst it.  
  368How can you inflate that?  
  369Come on, now! 
  370The # isn't sleeping. 
  371This has no effect.   
  372does not seem to do anything useful  
  373is not notably useful 
  374isn't very interesting  
  375doesn't appear worthwhile  
  376has no effect 
  377doesn't do anything   
  378Kicking a # #.   
  379Waving a # #. 
  380Playing in this way with a # #. 
  381Fiddling with a # #.  
  382Pushing the # #. 
  383I don't think so.  
  384This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!   
  385How can you tie that to anything? 
  386You can't tie the # to that. 
  387You could certainly never tie the # with that! 
  388The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.  
  389Why would you tie up a #?  
  390You can't turn that.  
  391You certainly can't turn it with a #.  
  392Digging with the # is slow and tedious.   
  393Digging with a # is silly. 
  394I don't think that anybody is home.  
  395Why knock on a #?  
  396It sounds like there is something inside the #.  
  397The contents of the # spill out.  
  398I can't get to that to move it. 
  399You can't move the #. 
  400You can't turn that on. 
  401It is already on.  
  402You can't turn that off.   
  403It is already off. 
  404The # is now on. 
  405The # is now off.  
  406It is now pitch black.  
  407You must tell me how to do that to a #.   
  408The # cannot be opened. 
  409Opened.  
  410Opening the # reveals:  
  411The # cannot be closed. 
  412It is already open.   
  413It is already closed. 
  414Closed.  
  415There is a # here. 
  416You are carrying a #. 
  417It is in the #, which is in the room.  
  418It is in the #, which you are carrying.   
  419Time passes...   
  420The # must be on the ground to be boarded.  
  421I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.   
  422You are already in the #, cretin! 
  423You are now in the #. 
  424You aren't in that!   
  425You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably   
  425be fatal.   
  426You are on your own feet again. 
  427You can't go there without a vehicle.  
  428You can't go there in a #. 
  429I see nothing special about the #.   
  430It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue. 
  431You are in the #.  
  432The # has died.  
  433The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in 
  433the guttural tongue of the trolls.   
  434The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his  
  434bloody axe. 
  435An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out   
  435of the room are open. 
  436A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages 
  436out of the room. 
  437The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.  
  438The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time". 
  439The troll laughs at your puny gesture. 
  440The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #  
  441The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift 
  442and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.  
  443and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the  
  443troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does 
  443not look pleased.  
  444Sadly, a # can't be put in a #. 
  445You can't take the #. 
  446Aren't you forgetting something?  
  447That would be a good trick.  
  448The # is too big to jump over.  
  449You should have looked before you leaped. 
  450I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame. 
  451In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.   
  452Geronimo... 
  453I don't think that the # would agree with you. 
  454I think you should get that first.   
  455Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.  
  456How can I drink that? 
  457I'd like to, but I can't get to that.  
  458Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all 
  458this talking. 
  459The # catches fire.   
  460Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.  
  461You don't have that.  
  462The # catches fire and is consumed.  
  463I don't think you can burn a #. 
  464It doesn't seem to work.   
  465Can you unlock a grating with a #?   
  466Munging a # #.   
  467Trying to kill a # #. 
  468Trying to attack a # #. 
  469There is nothing here to attack.  
  470I've known strange people, but attacking a #?  
  471with your bare hands is suicidal  
  472with that is very self-destructive   
  473You are in perfect health. 
  474You have a light wound. 
  475You have a serious wound.  
  476You have several wounds.   
  477You have serious wounds.   
  478You are at death's door.   
  479You can be killed by one more light wound.  
  480You can be killed by a serious wound.  
  481You can survive one serious wound.   
  482You are strong enough to take several wounds.  
  483You have been killed once. 
  484You have been killed twice.  
  485This gives you the rank of Cheater.  
  486This gives you the rank of Wizard.   
  487This gives you the rank of Master.   
  488This gives you the rank of Winner.   
  489This gives you the rank of Hacker.   
  490This gives you the rank of Adventurer. 
  491This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.  
  492This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.  
  493This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer. 
  494This gives you the rank of Beginner. 
  495Your sword is no longer glowing.  
  496Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.  
  497Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
  498Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous  
  498neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows. 
  499The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly 
  499recovers his stilletto. 
  500His booty remains. 
  501As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his  
  501treasures reappear:  A #.  
  502  A #. 
  503There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning   
  503against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.   
  504There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the  
  504ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished. 
  505The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and  
  505when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.   
  506Once you got him, what would you do with him?  
  507You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although  
  507it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does 
  507seem angered by your attempt.   
  508You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.  
  509You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,  
  509but the contents of his bag fall on the floor. 
  510Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness. 
  511The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as 
  511stupid as you are? 
  512The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely. 
  513The candles are not lit.   
  514The flame is extinguished. 
  515Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to 
  515burn.  
  516With what?  
  517The candles are lit.  
  518The candles are already lit. 
  519You have to light them with something that's burning, you know. 
  520You realize just in time that the candles are already lit. 
  521The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.   
  522Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue. 
  523Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you. 
  524You can't go that way.  
  525The # is closed. 
  526I can't reach that.   
  527You aren't carrying that.  
  528Dropped. 
  529Thrown.  
  530You watch as the balloon slowly lands. 
  531The balloon has landed. 
  532You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.   
  533You watch as the balloon slowly descends. 
  534The balloon descends. 
  535You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.   
  536Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and 
  536causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?  
  537You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.  
  538The balloon ascends.  
  539You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending, 
  539due to its light load.  
  540The balloon leaves the ledge.   
  541You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.  
  542The balloon slowly rises from the ground. 
  543The cloth bag is draped over the side. 
  544The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning   
  544in the receptacle. 
  545The balloon is tied to the hook.  
  546I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way. 
  547You are tied to the ledge. 
  548You don't really want to hold a burning #.  
  549The receptacle is already occupied.  
  550The # burns inside the receptacle.   
  551The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air. 
  552Not likely. 
  553An interesting idea, but...  
  554A valiant attempt. 
  555You can't be serious. 
  556Not a prayer. 
  557You already have it.  
  558Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.  
  559Taken. 
  560Nice try.   
  561I can't do that. 
  562I can't reach inside. 
  563How can you do that?  
  564The # is already in the #. 
  565It won't fit. 
  566I can't reach the #.  
  567The cage shakes and is hurled across the room. 
  568"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth." 
  569"My vision is not that good without eyes."  
  570"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."   
  571ECHO   
  571The acoustics of the room change subtly.  
  572Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of 
  572sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the  
  572carcass has disappeared.   
  573The # contains:  
  574Your collection of treasures consists of: 
  575You are carrying:  
  576The # is carrying: 
  577By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to 
  577stop the leak in the dam.  
  578You are empty handed. 
  579It is too dark in here to see.  
  580#:  
  581I couldn't find anything.
  582I couldn't find any valuables.  
  583Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the  
  583walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that 
  583the bag will be taken only over his dead body. 
  584Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of  
  584valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful  
  584nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.  
  585The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.  
  585Fortunately, he took nothing.   
  586A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding 
  586nothing of value, he left disgruntled. 
  587A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through  
  587the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the  
  587room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto  
  587others before...". 
  588The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,  
  588left disgusted.  
  589The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not  
  589have noticed that he robbed you blind first.   
  590Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this 
  590fine # is doing here?"  
  591You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is  
  591ineffective.  
  592Attacking a dead # is pointless.  
  593Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless? 
  594The # slowly regains his feet.  
  595The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.  
  596It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid 
  596that you are dead. 
  597Saved. 
  598I can't access the save file.   
  599Restored.   
  600Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.  
  601I don't understand that.   
  602You cannot talk to that!   
  603You cannot talk through another person.   
  604Please input the entire command again. 
  605Fortunately, you still have a #.  
  606You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase   
  606leading up. 
  607A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere   
  607adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health 
  607and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very 
  607friendly, though he likes people. 
  608The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't  
  608think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for 
  608a cyclops.  
  609The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.  
  609His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.  
  610The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping 
  610blissfully at the foot of the stairs.  
  611On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which 
  611now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it. 
  612The bottle is closed. 
  613The bottle is already full.  
  614The bottle is now full of water.  
  615The water slips through your fingers.  
  616Too many prepositions.  
  617Too many objects.  
  618I can't see one here. 
  619Which one do you mean?  
  620I can't reach that from inside the #.  
  621What should I do with the #? 
  622Huh?   
  623You must supply a direct object.  
  624You must supply an indirect object.  
  625Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my 
  625abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition. 
  625Please let me express my profoundest regrets.  
  626The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge 
  626your greeting with his usual graciousness.  
  627The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts 
  627the # and stops to admire its beauty.  
  628The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.   
  629The # is empty.  
  630I don't know how to look inside a #. 
  631There is nothing interesting there.  
  632I don't really see how. 
  633The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.   
  634You can't wind a #.   
  635You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird. 
  636A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence 
  636in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty 
  636surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message 
  636brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company." 
  637An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a   
  637safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have   
  637forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the   
  637box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes 
  637here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks  
  637askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.  
  638The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;  
  638you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,  
  638leaving you alone in the bare room.  
  639Talk about eating rich foods!   
  640Nothing like having money to burn!   
  641"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with   
  641disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an 
  641understated "pop". 
  642The gnome carefully places the # in the   
  642deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear   
  642that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
  642disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.   
  643The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his 
  643fingers, leaving you alone.  
  644The gnome appears increasingly impatient. 
  645There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary. 
  646The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time. 
  647The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera. 
  647From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a  
  647limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so, 
  647a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top 
  647of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds   
  647down, the song bird flies away. 
  648The cliff is too steep for climbing. 
  649The egg is already open.   
  650There is no obvious way to open the egg.  
  651I doubt you could do that without damaging it. 
  652The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has   
  652seriously diminished its esthetic appeal. 
  653The concept of using a # is certainly original.  
  654Not to say that using a # isn't original either...  
  655Your rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage. 
  655The egg is now open.  
  656Climbing the walls is of no avail.   
  657Bizarre! 
  658The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged. 
  659The # falls to the ground. 
  660You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large   
  660branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach. 
  661On the ground below you can see:  
  662I can't see any wall here. 
  663That cannot be turned.  
  664You would be lost without me.   
  665You don't have the #. 
  666The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby. 
  667I can't see any song bird here. 
  668You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...  
  669You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.  
  670You can't go more than part way through the curtain.  
  671That would involve quite a contortion! 
  672You are in it, turkey!  
  673As you try, your hand seems to go through it.  
  674The # goes through it.  
  675The # passes through the wall and vanishes. 
  676The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.  
  677I can't do that with everything at once.  
  678There is a wall there.  
  679There is no way up.   
  680There is no way down. 
  681You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are  
  681dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.   
  681In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around   
  681which is engraved a compass rose. 
  682Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from  
  682pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent  
  682Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are  
  682portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped   
  682around formidable bludgeons. 
  683Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from  
  683pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent  
  683Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are  
  683portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped   
  683around formidable bludgeons. 
  684A passage enters from the south.  
  685The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with  
  685their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.   
  686To the north and south are large hallways.  
  687To the north is a large hallway.  
  688You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather 
  688complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor 
  688is open. 
  688   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of  
  688carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel 
  688is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left 
  688half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white   
  688opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the  
  688black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of 
  688the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.   
  688   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot  
  688deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the 
  688exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular   
  688depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this  
  688area is a compass rose. 
  688   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height  
  688is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced  
  688in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus 
  688in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room  
  688(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden   
  688pole.  
  688   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a 
  689foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on 
  689the stone floor. 
  690foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been 
  690dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor. 
  691foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted  
  691out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough  
  691friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.  
  692foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been 
  692dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.  
  693foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned 
  693above the stone channel in the floor.  
  694   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling 
  694through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The 
  694bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long  
  694attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and   
  694T-bar are pointing #.

  703end, inches above the floor. 
  704You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north 
  704and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north 
  704end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the 
  704room by a # lying on the floor. 
  705Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the   
  705sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of 
  705this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of   
  705the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the 
  705crypt to the south.  The door is #.  
  706You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern  
  706and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An  
  706additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor. 
  707In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door 
  707which is #. 
  708You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door   
  708and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.  
  709You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.  
  710The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The  
  710panel is #, and the door is #.  
  711You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern  
  711parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer   
  711towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west  
  711ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small   
  711window barred with iron.  The door is #.  
  712You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large  
  712parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the 
  712smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less 
  712bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself 
  712is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about 
  712two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,   
  712so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.   
  712   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are  
  712an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face  
  712of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points 
  712to the number "#".

  722You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west   
  722corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.   
  723Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #. 
  724You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely 
  724fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out

  725You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely

  725which seems to be #.  
  726   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon  
  726master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have  
  726solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume   
  726your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I 
  726waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you 
  726lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.  
  726You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a 
  726moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the 
  726treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist  
  726and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.   
  727Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat 
  727disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.   
  727As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you  
  727and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of  
  727Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the  
  727future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time 
  727transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say   
  727   INCANT, <word>  
  727and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying   
  727   INCANT, <phrase>  
  727Good luck, and choose wisely!"  
  728The button pops back to its original position. 
  729The mirror quietly swings shut. 
  730The pine wall closes quietly.   
  731The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.  
  732The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.  
  733The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians. 
  734The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #. 
  735The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move. 
  736The pine wall swings open. 
  737The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.  
  738The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't   
  738budge. 
  739The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.   
  740The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.  
  741The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians. 
  742The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his  
  742suspicions are aroused. 
  743Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by 
  743them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer  
  743the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they 
  743resume their posts.   
  744A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions   
  744are aroused.  
  745Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.   
  745Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and   
  745they manage to dispatch you effortlessly. 
  746The statues are impassive. 
  747The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your 
  747blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises 
  747his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it 
  747completes you crumble into dust.  
  748"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!" 
  749The pole is now slightly above the floor. 
  750The pole cannot be raised further.   
  751The pole cannot be lowered further.  
  752The pole is lowered into the channel.  
  753The pole is lowered into the stone hole.  
  754The pole is already resting on the floor. 
  755The pole now rests on the stone floor. 
  756The button becomes depressed.   
  757The button pops back out.  
  758The button is already depressed.  
  759No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well. 
  760The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.   
  761You can't break the beam with a #.   
  762The # already breaks the beam.  
  763I see no bronze door here. 
  764The bronze door opens.  
  765The bronze door closes. 
  766On the other size of the door is a narrow passage which opens out  
  766into a larger area.   
  767The door won't budge. 
  768The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there  
  768will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden   
  768panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an  
  768old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:  
  768   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure  
  768that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are  
  768admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether   
  768you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great 
  768Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for  
  768one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly 
  768discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon. 
  768Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five 
  768attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and 
  768admit you to these regions.  
  768   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'." 
  769The booming voice asks: 
  770"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing 
  770through the cyclops room?" 
  771"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?" 
  772"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid  
  772treasures, in Zorkmids?"   
  773"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"  
  774"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?" 
  775"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?" 
  776"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"  
  777"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"  
  778The door is securely fastened.  
  779The wooden door opens.  
  780The wooden door closes. 
  781The dungeon master says, "I will stay."   
  782The dungeon master says, "I will follow." 
  783There is no reply. 
  784"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you." 
  785"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell." 
  786"I cannot perform that action for you."   
  787This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.  
  788This gives you the rank of Super Cheater. 
  789This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.  
  790This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.   
  791This gives you the rank of Cheater.  
  792You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice 
  792says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!" 
  792In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It  
  792is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four 
  792headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the 
  792cryptic inscription:  
  792  
  792         "Feel Free".   
  793The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.  
  794The crypt is already open. 
  795The crypt is already closed. 
  796The crypt is closed.  
  797The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#". 
  798There is no answer.   
  799No one seems to be listening.   
  800The dungeon master says, "Excellent."  
  801The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."  
  802The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances." 
  803The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."   
  804The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance." 
  805The mirror is closed. 
  806You must specify what to set the dial to. 
  807The dial face contains only numbers. 
  808The dial now points to "#".  
  809The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.  
  810The cell door is now closed. 
  811You notice that the dungeon master does not follow. 
  812The dungeon master catches up with you.   
  813The dungeon master follows you. 
  814There is a wooden wall blocking your way. 
  815There is a large mirror blocking your way.  
  816There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.   
  817The structure blocks your way.  
  818As you leave, the door swings shut.  
  819You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.   
  820You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.   
  821You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel   
  821which once contained a mirror.  
  822You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel   
  822which once contained a mirror.  
  823The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward. 
  824The panel has been opened outward.   
  825The opposite wall is solid rock.  
  826The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,  
  826obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head  
  826and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days." 
  826With that, he departs.  
  827The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a  
  827master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive   
  827wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.  
  828Saves are not permitted during the endgame. 
  829Restores are not permitted during the endgame. 
  830The structure rotates clockwise.  
  831The structure rotates counterclockwise.   
  832I can't see a mirror here. 
  833I don't see any way to open the mirror here.   
  834The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.  
  835The mirror has already been broken.  
  836The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward  
  836as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather   
  836fragile. 
  837The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.  
  838I can't see a panel here.  
  839I don't see any way to open the panel here. 
  840To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.  
  841The panel is not that easily destroyed.   
  842The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out 
  842when you let go. 
  843The panel is unyielding.   
  844A disheveled adventurer stares back at you. 
  845The mirror is broken into little pieces.  
  846Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with. 
  847The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small 
  848hallways to the #east and #west.  
  849A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.  
  850A large panel fills the # side of the hallway. 
  851The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.   
  852The corridor continues north.   
  853The corridor continues south.   
  854The corridor continues north and south.   
  855Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.  
  856That incantation seems to have been a failure. 
  857Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.  
  858That spell has no obvious effect. 
  859As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness 
  859envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.  
  860The structure won't budge. 
  861You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east. 
  862You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.  
  863The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel   
  863door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment 
  863later, a previously unseen sign flashes:  
  863   "Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"  
  864The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously  
  864unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,   
  864now atomized, spews through the slot.  
  865I can't see any ladder here. 
  866Come, come! 
  867You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.  
  868You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with  
  868marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.  
  869It appears the thief was correct. 
  870In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening. 
  871The center of the floor is noticeably depressed here. 
  872The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side   
  872of the door is a small slit. 
  873The west wall here has a large opening at its center.  On one side 
  873of the opening in a small slit. 
  874There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the east wall.  
  875There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the west wall.  
  876There is only a passage in that direction.  
  877The wall does not budge.   
  878The wall slides forward and you follow it...   
  878The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further  
  878descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3   
  878grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone  
  878and marble.  The following notations will be used:  
  878                   ..  = current position (middle of grid)  
  878                   MM  = marble wall  
  878                   SS  = sandstone wall 
  878                   ??  = unknown (blocked by walls). 
  879The wall slides forward and you follow it to the following position: 
  880Your position is as follows: 
  881The exit is too far above your head. 
  882With the help of the ladder, you exit the puzzle.   
  883Don't be lazy, type the command yourself. 
  884In the MDL sources, NOOBJ is described as a "hack".  As we are  
  884above such practices, NOOBJ is not implemented.  
  885The grating closes.

  134The thief entertains himself by rifling your pack.

  136throat.  
  137The thief, who is essentially a pragmatist, dispatches you as a threat  
  137to his livelihood.

   31You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you. 
   32You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the  
   32east, there appears to be sunlight.  
   33You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One   
   33particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.   
   34You are in a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except 
   34to the east, where a small clearing may be seen. 
   35You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you. 
   37You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway. 
   37Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase   
   37descends.   
   38You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing  
   38is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages  
   38can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.   
   42You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path 
   42travels to the north and the east.   
   43You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow 
   43to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting 
   43walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on. 
   44You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an  
   44ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.   
   46You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.  
   46To the south and west are small passageways.   
   47You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are 
   47exits to the southeast and upward.   
   48You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off  
   48to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of 
   48flowing water below.  
   49You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from 
   49the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone 
   49stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it  
   49is difficult to hear yourself think. 
   52You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway 
   52leading down. 
   53You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,  
   53forbidding staircase leading down.   
   54You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to  
   54the south and southwest.   
   55You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,  
   55However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.  
   56You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway   
   56intersects with a northward path. 
   57You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit 
   57on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be  
   57heard faintly to the north.  
   58You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a   
   58coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE  
   58WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and  
   58there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance 
   58of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the 
   58north is a small opening.  
   59You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal 
   59mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine, 
   59and there is another exit on the south end of the room.  
   60You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming  
   60from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south. 
   61You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft   
   61descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and 
   61the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
   61shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.  
   62You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across  
   62the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into 
   62paths running west and northeast. 
   63You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction 
   63of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the 
   63east is a narrow path.  
   64You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas. 
   65You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden   
   65ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is  
   65also a staircase leading upward.  
   66You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   67You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   68You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   69You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   70You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   71You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   72You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine. 
   73You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a  
   73narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages 
   73leaving the room.  
   74Dead end.   
   75You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken 
   75timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the  
   75southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.   
   76You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long 
   76shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow  
   76passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.   
   81You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east. 
   81There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.   
   82You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be 
   82seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow  
   82passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south. 
   84You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast. 
   85A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The   
   85path exits to the south and to the east.  
   86You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but  
   86the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly  
   86damp here.  
   87A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the  
   87cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions. 
   88Dead end.   
   89Dead end.   
   90You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast. 
   91This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down. 
   91To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the 
   91following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without  
   91solving this riddle-- 
   91   What is tall as a house,  
   91   Round as a cup, 
   91   And all the king's horses can't draw it up?". 
   92This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.  
   95You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of 
   95stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west. 
   96You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an  
   96ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. 
   96The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the   
   96room is through huge marble pillars. 
   97You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what  
   97appears to be an altar. 
   99This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring 
   99the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked   
   99"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south. 
  100You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood  
  100control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the  
  100room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of   
  100the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
  100panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of   
  100different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this  
  100room are in the west and south ends. 
  102You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the  
  102east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about 
  102cyclops sized).  
  103This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number 
  103of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about  
  103on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly  
  103created passage to the east. 
  104You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls  
  104and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. 
  104Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and   
  104northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An  
  104extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although  
  104you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you  
  104could get back down.  
  105You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here  
  105have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals   
  105left through the north, south, or west exits.  
  106You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you 
  106and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the 
  106river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching  
  106from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its   
  106way downstream.  
  107You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river 
  107flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore. 
  108The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the 
  108dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks 
  108prevent landing on the west. 
  109The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on 
  109the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which 
  109may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.   
  110You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the  
  110white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south   
  110along the cliffs.  
  111You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A 
  111narrow path leads north along the shore.  
  112The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be  
  112that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small 
  112area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs. 
  113The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west 
  113shore is a large landing area.  
  115You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat  
  115treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end 
  115quickly turning around a sharp corner. 
  116You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is 
  116flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here. 
  117You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is  
  117to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here. 
  118You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.  
  119You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the  
  119barrel is the word "GERONIMO!". 
  121You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk  
  121on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow  
  121travels east-west here. 
  122You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River   
  122past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white   
  122cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from  
  122above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path 
  122continues to the southeast.  
  123You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable   
  123here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the 
  123runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path. 
  124You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.  
  124You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists 
  124along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the 
  124canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears  
  124climbable.  
  125You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here  
  125there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River   
  125upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still  
  125appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and  
  125northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. 
  125Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the 
  125top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the 
  125west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles 
  125around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.   
  126You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you  
  126light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only 
  126exit here is to the north. 
  127You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The 
  127top of the volcano is clearly visible here. 
  128You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming   
  128above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the 
  128west side.  
  129You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of 
  129the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the  
  129east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.   
  130You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet   
  130across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.  
  131You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant 
  131volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the 
  131floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.  
  132You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you 
  132the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.  
  132A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;   
  132it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between 
  132those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.  
  134You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably   
  134for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed 
  134to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.  
  136You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow. 
  136There are exits here to the west and the south.  
  139You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room  
  139smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring   
  139sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons   
  139which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,  
  139above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign  
  139above all the buttons says in English: 
  139  
  139             DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE  
  139  
  139There are exits to the west and the south.  
  140You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall 
  140is a small sticker which reads: 
  140  
  140           Protected by   
  140             FROBOZZ 
  140       Magic Alarm Company  
  140          (Hello, footpad!).  
  141You are trapped inside an steel cage.  
  142You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on 
  142the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the   
  142entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily. 
  143You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and 
  143mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be   
  143some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west. 
  144You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large  
  144oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the  
  144objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern 
  144corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high. 
  144There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.  
  145You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden  
  145posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to 
  145be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be  
  145abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large  
  145chasm on the west and the northwest. 
  146You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a 
  146large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is 
  146falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.   
  148You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest  
  148banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial 
  148account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with   
  148the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit   
  148less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography  
  148"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!". 
  148Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All 
  148that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of 
  148the room, which say   
  148  
  148   <-- WEST VIEWING ROOM        EAST VIEWING ROOM -->  
  149You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer   
  149whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.  
  149On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".  
  149On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading  
  149  
  149            BANK PERSONNEL ONLY  
  150You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer   
  150whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.  
  150On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".  
  150On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading  
  150  
  150            BANK PERSONNEL ONLY  
  151You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view  
  151their contents.  On the north size of the room is a sign which says  
  151  
  151   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX   
  151    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH 
  151     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM  
  151      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA! 
  151               Thank you for banking at the Zork!   
  152You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view  
  152their contents.  On the north size of the room is a sign which says  
  152  
  152   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX   
  152    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH 
  152     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM  
  152      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA! 
  152               Thank you for banking at the Zork!   
  153You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There 
  153are no exits from this room. 
  154You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.  
  155You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here 
  155were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected, 
  155all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west, 
  155and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"  
  155of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the  
  155room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on  
  155the side of the cube is some lettering.   
  156This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork. 
  156Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.  
  156The lone exit is to the north.  
  158You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to  
  158a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the   
  158passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.  
  159You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the 
  159south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-  
  159inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall 
  159is a red button. 
  180You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor 
  180widens into larger areas as it turns east at its northern and 
  180southern ends.   
  181You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor 
  181widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and 
  181southern ends.   
  187You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated 
  187in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its  
  187contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.  
  187   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of  
  187zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.  
  187   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes   
  187as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of 
  187the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and  
  187other informative and inspiring works. 
  187   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of  
  187Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,   
  187and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.  
  187   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock  
  187certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo 
  187International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company   
  187of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.  
  188You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently 
  188created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten 
  188feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There  
  188are exits to the west and south.

    1On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.  
   11A bottle is sitting on the table. 
   12A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.   
   13On a table is a nasty-looking knife. 
   14On hooks above the mantlepiece hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.  
   15A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.   
   21Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.  
   22The deceased adventurer's useless lantern is here.  
   31On the floor lies a moby ruby.  
   32On the shore lies Neptune's own crystal trident. 
   34Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory. 
   45Lying half buried in the mud is an old trunk, bulging with jewels. 
   46Lying in the corner of the room is a small brass bell.   
   47On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.
   48On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.   
   49A guidebook entitled "FLOOD CONTROL DAM #3" is on the 
   49reception desk.  
   60Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on   
   60the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty. 
   85At the end of the rainbow is a pot of gold. 
   92A sharp stick, which appears to have been broken at one end, is here.   
  104On the floor is a gold zorkmid coin (a valuable collector's item). 
  108The excessively gaudy crown of Lord Dimwit Flathead is here.  
  121There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced 
  121by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.  
  122There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the  
  122paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be  
  122distinguished now. 
  148On the floor sit 200 neatly stacked zorkmid bills.  
  149A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall. 
  153On the branch is a small birds nest. 
  154In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,  
  154apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is  
  154covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and 
  154mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a   
  154delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely 
  154fragile. 
  157There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It has ruby  
  157eyes and a silver beak.  Through a crystal window below its left   
  157wing you can see intricate machinery inside.  It appears to have   
  157wound down. 
  158There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It seems to  
  158have recently had a bad experience.  The mountings for its jewel-like   
  158eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled.  Through a cracked  
  158crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of 
  158intricate machinery.  It is not clear what result winding it would 
  158have, as the mainspring appears sprung.   
  188Nestled inside the niche is an engraved gold card.  
   41The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by 
   41an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the  
   41ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs 
   41are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred 
   41texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems   
   41to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.  
   44The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly  
   44remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can  
   44be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-  
   44mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The 
   44final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the   
   44dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient 
   44Zorkers were obscure indeed. 
   47            Commandment #12592  
   47Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":   
   47Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods? 
   47Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones. 
   47Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?   
   47Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!  
   47Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and 
   47unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last. 
   47Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

   49          Flood Control Dam #3  
   49  
   49  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the 
   49Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the   
   49Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million 
   49zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local  
   49tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure   
   49is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the 
   49center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind  
   49the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million 
   49square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.  
   49  
   49  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to 
   49the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave  
   49drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear   
   49tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234 
   49bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),   
   4912,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape   
   49processors, and nearly one million dead trees. 
   49  
   49  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of   
   49FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

   5030-AUG-90                            Late Dungeon Edition   
   50  
   50           --- LATE NEWS FLASH!! ---  
   50  
   50The endgame is here!  (Somewhere) 
   50There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.  
   50  
   50         --- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---  
   50  
   50This version of Dungeon has been converted from the DECUS version for
   50the PDP-11/VAX-11, which was itself completely reimplemented in 
   50FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created at MIT. 
   50  
   50This version is intended to be reasonable portable to all sorts  
   50of computers, large and, by 1990 standards, small, except those

   51Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used  
   51to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech   
   51I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."   
   51  
   51Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look 
   51forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising 
   51future and make really big Zorkmids."  
   51  
   51MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when 
   51you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

   52             Welcome to Dungeon!  
   52  
   52   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it 
   52you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal 
   52man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained  
   52within.  
   52  
   52   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets  
   52of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for 
   52vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by  
   52fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!   
   52  
   52  
   52   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT  
   52Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce 
   52Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of 
   52Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax  
   52and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).   
   52The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by  
   52a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.
